# TilePlotChr1
Trying to first figure out best binning, then compare SAMtools settings

I'm playing around with Chr1 of a teosinte x B73 F2 to try and determine good settings for mpileup on some real data. I'm interested in plotting the different genotype states at loci across the chromosome. Using some code from vsbuffalo to get started. Initally, I'm just trying to get things running on the cluster and determine the best binning (the tiles) to use for comparing outputs. Then, I will make 9 plots (have 9 settings testing, initially) and determine the best and if I want to try a few more combinations of settings.
